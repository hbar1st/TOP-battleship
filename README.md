Battleship game to be played either against the computer or against someone who is nearby (please exchange seats or move the device monitor to allow 2 players to play against each other).

The ships are initially configured in a random setup for you. If you wish to change the setup, click once on any ship to turn on drag-and-drop mode. Click again on the same ship to turn on rotation mode to rotate. You must click the rotate anchor image in order to rotate. Rotation may not always be possible if there are nearby ships in the way. You may have to drag the ship somewhere free and then rotate. The rotation happens around the endpoint that is closest to the origin. The origin is the point that represents the lowest-leftmost corner of the grid.

Playing against the computer runs a bit faster, so try this if you are in a rush. Enjoy!
